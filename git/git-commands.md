## Git Commands

### git reflog 
Shows the status of current repo with all the previous commits and its position in relations to HEAD.

### reset
`git reset --hard HEAD~2`
Reset to HEAD~2 without keeping any of the commits

There is also soft reset which is good for resets where you would want to go back to where you were before.

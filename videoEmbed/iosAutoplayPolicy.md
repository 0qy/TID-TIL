## IOS Autoplay Policy 

Ipads and iphones have a strict no autoplay policy for data conservation reason. The playback needs to be specifically activated by user actions. 

Example on appl developer: 
this would play 
`<input type="button" value="Play" onclick="document.myMovie.play()">`

this wouldn't
`This does nothing on iOS: `<body onload="document.myMovie.play()">`
